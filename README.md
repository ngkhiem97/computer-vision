## Image Classification with InceptionV3

Details about the project is located at [Image Classification with InceptionV3](.pretrained_image_classification/README.md).

Image classification is a fascinating field of artificial intelligence, and Inception V3 is a neural network architecture that has pushed the boundaries of what's possible in this area. Developed by Google, Inception V3 is designed to accurately classify images with a high degree of accuracy, thanks to its use of deep convolutional neural networks. Its ability to recognize objects, people, and even animals in complex images is truly remarkable. In this project, we trained a Inception V3 model with dogs and cats dataset to classify images into 2 categories, such as dogs and cats.

## Image Classification with ResNet50

Details about the project is located at [Image Classification with ResNet50](.image_classification/README.md).

ResNet50 is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals. In this project, we trained a ResNet50 model with CiFAR-10 dataset to classify images into 10 object categories, such as airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

## Object Localization

Details about the project is located at [Object Localization](.object_localization/README.md).
